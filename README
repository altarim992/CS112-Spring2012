I don't really have much background in programming, but I do know a bit about using a command line, partition editing, and troubleshooting problems in Windows, OSX, and Ubuntu. I have a fairly basic understanding of how programming works, but I don't actually know any languages, except a tiny bit of html. However, computer science in general is something I want to study, and so I hope to not only learn Python, but also learn some useful tools for how to pursue learning other programming languages later on.
